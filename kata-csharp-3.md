# Heroes in Training 🧙‍♂️⚔️

Let’s build the beginning of a small RPG character system.

We’re going to model heroes that can train and grow stronger.

## Your Task

### 1. Create an abstract class called `Hero`

Add two properties:

* `Name` (string)
* `Level` (int)

Add:

* A constructor that sets `Name`
* `Level` should default to `1`

Add an abstract method:

```csharp
public abstract string Describe();
```

This forces all hero types to describe themselves differently.

### 2. Create an interface called `ITrainable`

It should contain one method:

```csharp
void Train();
```

Anything that is *trainable* can increase in level.

### 3. Create a class called `Mage`

* Inherit from `Hero`
* Implement `ITrainable`
* Add a property: `Mana` (int)

Requirements:

* Default `Mana` to 30
* Override `Describe()`
* Implement `Train()` so that:

  * `Level++`
  * `Mana += 5`

### 4. Create a class called `Warrior`

* Inherit from `Hero`
* Implement `ITrainable`
* Add a property: `Stamina` (int)

Requirements:

* Default `Stamina` to 80
* Override `Describe()`
* Implement `Train()` so that:

  * `Level++`
  * `Stamina += 10`

## Expected Output (Example)

When running the application, the console should resemble the following outputs:

```
Before training:

Mage: Nia (Level 1) - Mana: 30
Warrior: Koba (Level 1) - Stamina: 80

Training...

After training:

Mage: Nia (Level 2) - Mana: 35
Warrior: Koba (Level 2) - Stamina: 90
```

Hint: Store a List of Heroes to call `Describe()`. Then when you want to look to `Train()`, you can use a new keyword:

```c#
foreach(var hero in heroes)
{
    if(hero is ITrainable) // Checks if the Hero also is a ITrainable. Meaning, it can be trained. 
    {
        hero.Train();
    }
}
```

## Reminders

* `Hero` must be `abstract`
* `Describe()` must be overridden in both child classes
* Use `: Hero, ITrainable` when inheriting and implementing
* `Level++` happens inside `Train()`

## Bonus (Optional)

1. Add validation so:

   * `Name` cannot be empty
   * `Level` cannot be less than 1

2. Create a new hero type:

   * `Archer`
   * Give it its own stat (e.g. `Accuracy`)
   * Make it trainable
